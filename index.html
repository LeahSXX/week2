      The John Crerar Library is home to collections in the biological,
      medical, and physical sciences as well as collections in general
      science and the philosophy and history of science, medicine, and
      technology. Opened in 1984, the library resulted from the merger
      of the John Crerar Library, established in Chicago in 1894, with
      the University of Chicago. The mission of the John Crerar Library
      is to serve the educational and research aims of the University
      of Chicago while continuing to honor the spirit of John Crerar
      by welcoming visitors to use the research collections at the library.
      Please contact Crerar Reference Services at 773-702-7715 for
      more information.
